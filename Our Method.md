### 1. Only Encoder for pre-training, No Decoder.  
loss function = clustering loss. 
  
### 2. Only Encoder for pre-training, New Decoder created in the downstream task.  
loss function = reconstruction loss + clustering loss. 
  
### 3. Encoder & Decoder for pre-training.
loss function = reconstruction loss + clustering loss.
